# Pathify
Route Planning Optimized</br>
</br>
Given a set of destinations to visit in order, Pathify provides the shortest path between each pair of destinations. This is useful for delivery drivers (food, mail, packages etc.) as well as carpooling or simply planning a road trip. Note, this only currently works for the state of Colorado, USA</br>

Note that Heroku servers ‘sleep’ after a 30 minute inactivity period, so visiting the URL the first time and requesting a path may take up to 60 seconds to load and unidle the server
