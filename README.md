# Pathify
Route Planning Optimized</br>
</br>
Given a set of destinations to visit in order, Pathify provides the shortest path between each pair of destinations. This is useful for delivery drivers (food, mail, packages etc.) as well as carpooling or simply planning a road trip. Note, this only currently works for the state of Colorado, USA</br>
